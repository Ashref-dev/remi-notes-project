## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Installation**
1. **Download** the latest release from GitHub
2. **Extract** the zip file and **drag Remi** to your Applications folder
3. **Install the unsigned app** (since this is a development build):
   - **Right-click** on Remi.app in Applications
   - Select **"Open"** from the context menu
   - Click **"Open"** in the security warning dialog
   - macOS will remember this choice for future launches
4. **Launch Remi** - it'll appear in your menu bar
5. **Set your hotkey** in Preferences (default: ⌘+Shift+R)

> **Note**: This is an unsigned development build. The right-click → Open method is required only for the first launch to bypass macOS Gatekeeper security.

### **Quick Setup**
1. **Create your first Nook** - click the "+" button
2. **Add your content** - paste in your most-used commands or notes
3. **Use the hotkey** to access instantly from anywhere
4. ### **Optional: Add Groq API key** for AI features
